For compactness the three permeability fields are not 
included here. To generate Kxx, Kyy and Kzz permeability 
fields for the 40x160x160 grid, use spe10perm.dat (SPE10 
permeability field) and the program from source speUpsc.f 
and name appropriately to include in spe5_v2.dat 

Note: Copies of the permeability can be also be found in 
/org/centers/csm/sgthomas/SPE10/spe10_40x160x160_K
