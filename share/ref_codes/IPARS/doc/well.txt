  I.  General

      A.  Well/reservoir interaction relates bottom-hole conditions in
          the wellbore to the conditions in grid elements that the
          wellbore penetrates.  Well management relates bottom-hole
          conditions to surface facility conditions. This appendix
          deals only with well/reservoir interaction.

      B.  The next section defines the theory.  The third section
          expounds on the use of oil-field units in simulators. The
          forth section defines input and calculations provided by the
          framework for all physical models. The fifth section defines
          some utility routines for outputing production data.

 II.  Theory

      A.  The volume rate of flow of a phase f from the wellbore to a
          grid element i is
                                        _
          Q    = G  L  K  k    (P     - P   ) / VIS
           f,i    i  i  i  f,i   WB,i    f,i       f,i

          The mass rate of flow of phase f is

      G.  P     = Wellbore pressure at the center of the open
           WB,i   interval in element i.  This quanity is related to
                  bottom hole pressure by

          1.  P     = P   + RHO   g (D     - D  )

          4.  g = gravitational constant.

          5.  D     = Depth at the center of the wellbore open
               WB,i   interval in element i.

      H.  P    = Formation pressure of phase f in element i at the
           f,i   depth of the center of the open interval in element i.
                 It may be necessary to adjust the element center
                 pressure for depth using
              _

          2.  P    = Phase pressure at the center of element i.

             = 2 * 3.14159 / (ln(r   / r ) + s)

          1.  r   = Equivalent radius of the grid element center
               eq

                  = .208 * length of a block edge in a plane normal to
                     the wellbore (isotropic permeabilities, square
                     grid elements, single-phase flow, well at the
                     center of an interior grid element). This quantity
                     is a strong function of grid and well
                     configuration.  See III.C.10 below.

      J.  Computation quantities.

          1.  The following definitions are introduced for
              computational convenience; no new physical quantities or
              equations are
              involved.  Note that none of the sums S   require a
                                                     fi

      K.  Single phase injection.

          1.  If k    < .01 then set k    = .01 so that phase f can be
                  f,i                 f,i
              injected into blocks where the phase is immobile.
              Incidentally, the well treatment purposed here is
              unstable if k    is set to 1.
                  f,i

          2.  Wellbore density.

              a.  RHO   = RHO  (P   + g RHO   D   )
                     WB      f   BH        WB  WC

              b.  D   = Difference in depth between the wellbore center
                   WC   and the bottom of hole.

              c.  Note that RHO  is a function and that D   is normally
                               f                         WC
                  negative.

              d.  For liquids, successive replacement is more than
                  adequate for evaluating II.K.2.a.

              e.  On the first time step, a wellbore density value is
                  required to start successive replacement.  I use

                  RHO   = S   / S
                     WB    f4    f1

          3.  The total rate from the well should be checked with
              equation II.J.9 to insure net flow into the formation.

          4.  Injection wells with specified P
                                              BH

              Injection rates to well elements can be calculated
              explicitly using equation II.A.  One recalculation of
              RHO   per Newtonian iteration is sufficient for liquids.
                 WB

          5.  Injection wells with specified mass rate, q
                                                         f
              a.  It is difficult to obtain an accurate distribution of
                  fluid along the wellbore when mass rate rather than
                  bottom-hole pressure is specified.  The problem lies
                  in the high covariance between bottom-hole and
                  formation pressures.  In theory, bottom-hole pressure
                  can be made a primary variable in the Newtonian
                  iteration but this requires a linear solver
                  capability we do not have.

              b.  One approach, mentioned in the literature, is to
                  calculate the injected fluid distribution along the
                  wellbore at the beginning of the time step and then
                  to freeze that distribution during Newtonian
                  iteration. My experience with this approach has been
                  that the distribution oscillates from one time step
                  to the next causing excessive Newtonian iterations to
                  recalculate the distribution each time step.  The
                  oscillation also shows up in the calculated
                  bottom-hole pressure.

              c.  My approach is to recalculate the distribution
                  initially and after the first Newtonian iteration
                  before freezing it.  This eliminates the oscillation
                  for the tests I have run to date; it would not
                  surprise me if under some conditions the distribution
                  should be recalculated three times.  The wellbore
                  density is also frozen when the distribution is
                  frozen but the bottom-hole pressure is recalculated
                  each Newtonian iteration.  Note that until the
                  distribution is frozen, the Jacobian contributions of
                  the wellbore must be included.  After the
                  distribution is frozen there is no wellbore
                  contribution to the Jacobian.  Failure to synchronize
                  the Jocobian calculation with the residual
                  calculation results in slow convergence or failure of
                  the Newtonian iteration.

      L.  Production

          1.  Note that by definition, the production rate q is
          negative.

          2.  Wellbore density.

              a.  RHO   = q  / Sum (q  / RHO )
                     WB    T    f    f      f

                  where RHO  = RHO  (P   + g RHO   D   )
                           f      f   BH        WB  WC

              b.  D   = Difference in depth between the wellbore center
                   WC   and the bottom of hole.

          3.  Production wells with specified P
                                               BH

              a.  Phase densities, RHO , can be evaluated by successive
                                      f
                  replacement using a value of RHO   from the previous
                                                  WB
                  Newtonian iteration or time step in equation
                  II.L.2.a. At the beginning of the first time step the
                  wellbore density required for this purpose can be
                  obtained from

                  RHO   = S  / S
                     WB    4    1

              b.  Wellbore density can not be calculated directly from
                  II.L.2.a since we do not know the flow rates.  The
                  flow rates can be eliminated by the following
                  manipulation
                  which results in a quadratic equation for wellbore
                  density.

              c.  From II.L.2.a , II.J.10 , and II.J.13 we have

                  RHO   Sum (S   P   + S   g RHO   - S  ) / RHO
                     WB  f    f4  BH    f5      WB    f6       f

                  = S  P   + S  g RHO   - S
                     4  BH    5      WB    6

              d.  Let

                  A = g Sum (S   / RHO )
                         f    f5      f

                  B = - g S  + Sum (S   P   - S  ) / RHO
                           5    f    f4  BH    f6       f

                  C = - S  P   + S
                         4  BH    6

              e.  Then
                                       2
                  RHO   = (- B + SQRT(B  - 4 A C)) / 2 A
                     WB

              f.  Production rates from well elements can now be
                  calculated explicitly using equation II.A.

              g.  Total phase rates from the well must be checked with
                  equation II.J.9 to insure net flow of each phase out
                  of the formation.  If the net flow of a phase is into
                  the formation (physically impossible for a production
                  well), then flow of that phase should be set to zero
                  in all well elements and the wellbore density and
                  bottom-hole pressure should be recalculated.

          4.  Production wells with specified total mass rate, q
                                                                T

              a.  The comments make above in II.K.5 for injection wells
                  with specified mass rate apply equally well to
                  production wells with specified mass rate.  Here,
                  there is the added complication of multiple phases
                  but this does not change the basic procedure.

              b.  As usual phase rate must be checked to insure net
              flow
                  of each phase from the formation.

III.  Well flow units

      A.  It is relatively easy to become confused by the question: Is
          a stock-tank volume a mass unit or a volume unit?  I maintain
          that it is a unit of mass.  If we place a fixed amount of
          fluid in a system closed to mass flow then no matter how we
          change the pressure and temperature, the number of stock-tank
          volumes remains the same.  This is true even if phase changes
          occur in the system.  On the other hand, the volume of the
          system may change radically as pressure and temperature are
          varied.  Thus stock-tank volume behaves like a unit of mass
          not a unit of volume.

      B.  A reservoir volume is a unit of volume since it is sensitive
          to insitu conditions.

      C.  Unfortunately, oil-field convention is to use different units
          of mass for various components and even different units for
          the same component from one field to the next.  Thus a
          stock-tank barrel of oil has a different weight in pounds
          from a stock-tank barrel of water.  This is analogous to
          using pounds to measure oil mass and kilograms to measure
          water mass.

      D.  Fortunately, the system of oil-field units is consistant.  If
          a reservoir simulator uses oil-field units both internally
          and externally, then there is little problem with units
          conversion. If, on the other hand, a simulator uses oil-field
          units externally for well rates and pounds internally for
          mass then great care must be exercised to insure proper units
          conversion. The Black-Oil Model uses oil-field units both
          internally and externally.  The Hydrology Model uses
          oil-field units externally and pounds internally.

      E.  Stock-tank density provides the essential conversion factor
          for converting between oil-field units and classical systems
          of units.  The IPARS framework inputs (or defaults)
          stock-tank densities and uses these values to modify its
          units conversion tables.  This allows the framework to extend
          its automated units conversion capability to include
          oil-field units.  Field units currently supported by IPARS
          and the corresponding stock-tank densities in the keyword
          input are as follows:

          [stbo] ==> stock-tank barrels of oil
          STDENO ==> stock-tank density of oil

          [stbw] ==> stock-tank barrels of water
          STDENW ==> stock-tank density of water

          [scf] ==> stock-tank standard cubic feet of gas
          [scm] ==> stock-tank standard cubic meters of gas
          STDENG ==> stock-tank density of gas

          [stb] ==> stock-tank barrels of oil plus water
          STDENW ==> stock-tank density of water

          Note that [stb] is a problem unit since the relative amounts
          of oil and water must be known before a conversion can be
          made to classical units.  I handle the problem by telling the
          units conversion system to use the stock-tank density of
          water to define the unit and then correct this assumption
          later when the relative amounts of the two phases are known.

 IV.  Framework well input and calculations

      A.  The framework calculates the geometric factor G , inputs the
                                                         i
          well type, and inputs bottom hole pressure or flow rate. 
          Other well input and calculations are the responsibility of
          the individual physical model.

      B.  Each well can be divided into a number of completion
          intervals that share a common wellbore.  A completion
          interval must occur in a single fault block but a well may
          extend over more than one fault block.

      C.  Keyword variables.

          1.  NUMWELL = Number of wells (default 0).

          2.  WELLNAME(n) = Name of well n (default "WELL").

          3.  INTERVALS(n)= Number of completion intervals in well
                            n (default 1).

          4.  WELLBLOCK(i,n) = Fault block containing interval i of
                               well n (default 1).

          5.  KINDWELL(n) = Well type (default 0)
                          = 0 ==> Well undrilled or shut in.
                          = 1 ==> Water Injection well, bhp specified.
                          = 2 ==> Water Injection well, rate specified.
                          = 3 ==> Production well, bhp specified.
                          = 4 ==> Production well, total rate
                          specified.

          6.  WELLTOP(3,i,n) = X,Y,Z coordinates of the top of interval
                               i of well n (no default)

          7.  WELLBOTTOM(3,i,n) = X,Y,Z coordinates of the bottom of
                                  interval i of well n (no default)

          8.  DIAMETER(i,n) = Wellbore diameter of interval i of
                              well n (default .5 feet)

          9.  SKIN(i,n) = Wellbore skin factor of interval i of
                          well n (default 0)

         10.  WELLGEOM(6,m) = I, J, K, NBLK, NWELL, and G of the m th
                          user-specified geometric factor.  NBLK is the
                          fault block number, NWELL is the well number,
                          and G is geometric factor defined in section
                          II.  The first five numbers for a given value
                          of m must be equal to or greater than 1 and
                          the sixth number must be greater than 0;
                          otherwise the entire set of six numbers is
                          ignored (defaults 0).  If the user does not
                          specify the geometric factor for a grid
                          element, then the formular in II.I is applied
                          with
                              r   = .208 * square root (element
                               eq   volume / wellbore length in the
                                    grid element)

         11.  WELLPQ(n) = Table input of either well mass rate or
                          bottom hole pressure versus time depending on
                          well type (no default).

         12.  WELLOUTKEY = Well data output key (default 0).
                         = 0 ==> Discard (do not collect well data)
                         = 1 ==> Print in standard output
                         = 2 ==> Output to disk
                         = 3 ==> Both print and disk output

         13.  WELLFILE   = File name for well output (default
                           WELLS.OUT) (30 characters max)

         14.  TYPICAL    = Number of wells at which an initial
                           formation profile is to be output (default
                           is the minimum of 4 or the number of wells).

      D.  Some well data can be input only in the initial data; other
          well data can be input in both the initial and transient
          data.

              NUMWELL        initial only
              WELLNAME       initial only
              INTERVALS      both
              WELLBLOCK      both
              KINDWELL       both
              WELLTOP        both
              WELLBOTTOM     both
              DIAMETER       both
              SKIN           both
              TYPICAL        initial only
              WELLGEOM       initial only
              WELLPQ         both
              WELLOUTKEY     both
              WELLFILE       both

      E.  Internal variables for well/reservoir interaction are
          documented in the include file wells.h .

      F.  SUBROUTINE WELSUM (NW, NVAL, VEC)

          1.  Forms one or more sums with each processor that has
              elements of a well contributing to each sum.  This
              routine is intended primarily for calculating average
              densities in the wellbore and total well rates. All
              processors must call this routine but only processors
              that share elements of a well will exchange messages.
              Note that this routine should be called from an executive
              routine.

          2.  NW    = Well number (input, INTEGER*4)

          3.  NVAL  = Number of values in VEC (input, INTEGER*4) (10
              MAX) (Must be the same on all processors)

          4.  VEC() = Current processor contributions to sums on input.
              Sum for all processors on output (REAL*8)

  V.  Production data output

      1.  Well production data for a large number of wells and
          processors presents a serious logistics problem.  The
          framework provides a passable solution to the problem.

      2.  At the end of each time step, each processor can store one
          value of production (or injection) data using

          CALL WELLOUT(N,K,V)

          where

          N = Well number (input, INTEGER*4)
          K = Data identification key (input, INTEGER*4)
          V = Data value (input, REAL*8)

      3.  Up to $MXHISQ values can be stored each time step.

      4.  Definition of the data identification key is a responsibility
          of the specific physical model but the framework does provide
          the following defaults:

          1 ==> WATER INJECTION RATE
          2 ==> OIL PRODUCTION RATE
          3 ==> WATER PRODUCTION RATE
          4 ==> GAS PRODUCTION RATE
          5 ==> WATER/OIL RATIO
          6 ==> GAS/OIL RATIO

          Up to $MXHISD identification keys may be used.  To define or
          redefine key 5, for example, insert the code line

          TITHIS(5)='CO2 INJECTION RATE'

          in subroutine xWDATA or some other model specific routine.

      5.  Every $MXHIST time steps and at the end of the simulation,
          the framework will output the collected data either to the
          standard printout or to a disk file (or both).  The form of
          the output is determined by the keyword WELLOUTKEY.
