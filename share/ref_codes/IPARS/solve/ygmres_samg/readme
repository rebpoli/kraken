Note: 1) Use SAMG as a stand alone solver
      2) Use SAMG as a preconditioner for the whole matrix (press and sat) accelerated by GMRES

Currently, I am not very sure how the SAMG handle the parallel situation or how to incorporate
IPARS and SAMG for multiple processors. IPARS uses domain decomposition method. The block matrixes
are computed by each processor individuals. What about SAMG? Does it require the imput of entire
matrix for the whole domain or it requires submatrix from each processors?

If IPARS and SAMG hands parallel part differently, e.g. use different domain decomposition, I guess
we have to use SAMG for subdomain solves as a preconditioner. In that case we may need extra 
sweeps of RB lsor after block Jacobi preconditioning by SAMG. Then we may need to do the following 
as in using SAMG for the pressure block in the two stage preconditioners.

 (a). allocate memory for solve_data->pwork (for 3 equations instead of one)
 (b). all slpresslinesorsolco after calling SAMG for lsor sweeps for pressure and saturations together.

 (*) An alternative solution is to apply directly the second stage lsor solve (as in the two-stage 
preconditioners) after calling SAMG. 


What I am doing now?
  Currently, I am just thinking about the single processor case and ignore the above (a) and (b) 
steps. Later, if it is necessare in parallel case, we can work it out either by implement (a) and (b)
or (*).
