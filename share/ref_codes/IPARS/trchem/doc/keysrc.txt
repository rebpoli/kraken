$ Keywords, source code additions/changes/corrections in TRCHEM 
$ in IPARSv3.1 (Dual approximation and EVMFEM are words used 
$ interchangeably in what follows)

$ Keywords:
---------------

Most same as in IPARSv2.1 except any reference to mortar. 
All references to mortar here in IPARSv3.1 are currently 
inconsequential since there is no mortar source and $MORTAR 
is always the fortran comment "C"

$ New files:
---------------

trdual.df     - Treatment of diffusion-dispersion and advection 
                for each species when using non-matching multi-
                block grids (somewhat analogous to the tdual.df 
                for implicit single-phase flow model)

$ Subroutines (and file in which definition appears)
---------------

TRDUALS       - Loads buffers for advection contribution for the 
                dual approximation block interfaces (trdual.df)

TRLODBUF      - Callwork subroutine called by TRDUALS (trdual.df)

TRDUALR       - Receives buffers for advection contributions for 
                the dual approximation block interfaces (trdual.df)

TRRCVBUF      - Callwork subroutine called by TRDUALR (trdual.df)

TRDUALJR      - Computes Jacobial and residual contributions for 
                the dual approximation block interface for the 
                diffusion-dispersion component of the transport 
                problem (trdual.df)

TRJRCAL       - Callwork subroutine called by TRDUALJR (trdual.df)

TRDCSLP       - Subroutine to compute element slopes for advection 
                of component concentration (or any other scalar 
                variable) for use in the higher-order Godunov (HOG) 
                scheme flux reconstruction (trdual.df)

TRDCSLPW      - Callwork subroutine called by TRDCSLP (trdual.df)

TRDADVECT     - Subroutine that actually performs advection across 
                fault block interfaces (trdual.df)

TRDADVW       - Callwork subroutine called by TRDADVECT (trdual.df)

DUALDDTR      - Subroutine that allows for varying diffusion tensor 
                with concentration (or with phase fluxes in case of
                dispersion) (trdual.df)

IFDDTRAN      - Subroutine computes interface transmissiblity for 
                diffusion-dispersion, called by DUALDDTR (trdual.df)

IFDDTRANW     - Callwork subroutine called by IFDDTRAN (trdual.df)

IFGES8v2      - Subroutine to load and interface buffer from a REAL*8 
                grid element array (trdual.df) 

IFTOBUF8v2    - Callwork subroutine called by IFGES8v2 (trdual.df)

Note: The treatment of HOG for advection is exactly similar to that  
in IPARSv2.1 except there is no reference to mortars. All the 
implementation is within trdual.df and calls to many of the above 
subroutines emanate from trstep.df
